## Tips

- **Write entries as things happen**, not at end of day — you might lose context
- **Include IDs** (email message IDs, calendar event IDs, reservation numbers) — makes follow-up easy
- **Keep it factual** — this is a log, not a journal
- **Review weekly** — move important patterns to relationships.md or preferences.md
