# AGENT_WORK.md — AI Task Queue

_Your AI's own task list. Separate from the human's todo.md._

**Why separate?** `todo.md` = things the human needs to do or decide. This file = things the AI is working on across sessions. A human todo might generate multiple agent work items.

## Rules

1. **Every task needs context** — file paths, email addresses, what's done, what's next
2. **Update timestamps** when you touch a task ("Last checked")
3. **Move to Completed** when done — don't delete (history matters)
4. **Blocked tasks** need a clear blocker — what are you waiting for?
5. **Check this file every session** — pick up where you left off
6. **One task, one row** — if it's complex, break it into subtasks
