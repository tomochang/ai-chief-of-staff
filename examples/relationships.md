# Relationships

_Last updated: 2026-02-18_

Track the people in your life — who they are, how to reach them, and the context your AI needs to be genuinely helpful.

## Quick Start (Minimal)

Start with just 3 people you email most. This alone makes a huge difference:

```markdown
### [Name] — [Role], [Company]
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Email | [email] |
| Relationship | [one line: client, boss, friend, etc.] |
| Communication style | [formal/casual, any quirks] |
```

Expand with assistants, dietary info, and interaction history as you go.

- **Update after every significant interaction** — your AI can only help with what it knows
- **Include communication style** — so drafts match the right tone (formal vs casual)
- **Note assistants/secretaries** — for scheduling, CC the right person
- **Record personal details** — dietary restrictions, birthdays, pet names. These make interactions human
- **Track relationship dynamics** — who reports to whom, who influences decisions
