# Todo

_Last updated: 2026-02-18_

Your AI uses this to track your schedule, action items, and pending decisions. Keep it current — stale todos are worse than no todos.

## Quick Start (Minimal)

Don't overthink it. Start with what's on your plate right now:

```markdown
## Action Items
| Item | Owner |
|------|-------|
| 🔴 [Urgent thing] | Me |
| 🟡 [This week] | Me |

## Waiting On
| Item | Waiting for |
|------|-------------|
| [Thing] | [Person] |
```

Add the full schedule table and completed section as you get comfortable.

## Tips

- **Use status emoji**: 🔴 Urgent, 🟡 This week, 🟢 Can wait, ⚪ Someday
- **Include context your AI needs**: who, when, where, what's already been done
- **Move completed items down** — don't delete them. Your AI uses history for context
- **"Waiting On" is crucial** — your AI can follow up proactively during email checks
- **Distinguish human todos vs agent tasks**: This file = your todos. Agent work items go in `memory/AGENT_WORK.md`
