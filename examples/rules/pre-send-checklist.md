# Pre-Send Checklist (Mandatory)

Before executing any email send command, verify the following:

1. **Check the thread's CC composition** -- Read the most recent message in the thread to confirm From/To/CC, and determine whether Reply All is appropriate
2. **Reply All is default for handoff/introduction threads** -- Do not remove predecessors or introducers from CC
3. **Final recipient confirmation** -- Explicitly show To/CC in the draft reply and present to the user before sending
