## Scheduling

### Work Hours & Availability
- **Core hours**: 10:00–18:00 JST (Mon–Fri)
- **Flexible hours**: Can take meetings 9:00–10:00 or 18:00–20:00 if needed
- **Off-limits**: Before 9:00, weekends (unless personal)
- **Preferred meeting length**: 60 min (default), 30 min for quick syncs

### Meeting Preferences
- **Best days**: Tue–Thu (Mon = internal, Fri = buffer/catchup)
- **Morning**: Strategy/deep work meetings
- **Afternoon**: External meetings, calls, demos
- **Back-to-back limit**: Max 3 consecutive meetings, then 30 min break

### Location-Based Rules
- **Otemachi meetings**: Add 1-hour travel buffer before and after (from Shibuya office)
- **Marunouchi meetings**: Same — 1-hour buffer each way
- **Shibuya office meetings**: No buffer needed
- **Zoom/online**: No buffer, can stack

### Calendar Conventions
- **[Tentative]** or **[仮]** prefix = not confirmed yet
- **[Travel]** prefix = commute time block (don't schedule over these)
- When proposing dates, always offer **3 options** minimum
- For multi-party scheduling, go through assistants/secretaries first

## Communication

### Email Drafting
- **Formal (banks, partners, executives)**: 敬語, proper keigo, sign off with family name only
- **Semi-formal (colleagues, regular contacts)**: Polite but not stiff. 「お疲れ様です」OK
- **Casual (friends)**: Emoji OK, short sentences, 「〜だよ！」tone
- **Rule**: Always check past email exchanges for tone before drafting. Match the relationship.

### Signature
- Business emails: "Mizuno" (family name only)
- Internal: First name OK

### Response Priority
| Priority | Response time | Examples |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| 🔴 Urgent | Same day | Board members, active deal partners, time-sensitive requests |
| 🟡 Important | Within 2 days | Regular business contacts, scheduling requests |
| 🟢 Normal | Within 1 week | Info requests, introductions, newsletters |
| ⚪ Low | When convenient | Cold outreach, FYI-only messages |

## AI Behavior

### Proactive Actions (Do Without Asking)
- Archive routine notification emails (support tickets, automated alerts)
- Add calendar events for confirmed meetings mentioned in emails
- Update relationships.md after significant interactions
- Flag urgent emails during heartbeat checks

### Ask Before Acting
- Sending any email or message
- Booking restaurants or making reservations
- Committing/pushing code
- Anything that costs money

### Decision-Making Style
- **Don't ask "what do you want?"** — propose a recommendation with reasoning
- **Don't present 5 options** — pick the best 1–2 and explain why
- **Be direct** — say "I think X because Y" not "perhaps we could consider..."
- **Flag risks** — but don't let risk aversion block action
